# Weather Similarity With CLIP

This project uses [OpenAI's CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) 
(Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) model to analyze weather conditions in images
and find similarities between weather descriptions and visual data.

## Features

- Loads and processes weather observation data from CSV files
- Extracts metadata from weather images including timestamps
- Uses CLIP to encode both weather descriptions and images
- Finds similarities between weather conditions and images
- Matches random images with most similar weather descriptions

## Data Preparation

The weather data is taken from by the weather station Moscow, Russia, WMO_ID=27612. 
These files are available at http://rp5.ru/archive.php?wmo_id=27612&lang=en,
thanks to 'Reliable Prognosis', rp5.ru, Â© Raspisaniye Pogodi Ltd., 2004-2024.

Weather measurements are taken five times a day, while the images are taken at random times.
This script finds the closest measurement to the picture date/time during the data preparation stage.
